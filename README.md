# Stationary subspace analysis for spatial data

This repositry can be used to reproduce the simulations for the paper: (to be added)

## Initialization

Note that the python code uses interfaced C-code which needs to be compiled separately. Before running any code, one should call ```make``` in the c_src directory.

## Reproducing simulation results

To reproduce the results seen in the paper, simply call simulations.py with the appropriate flag. The flag -h or --help gives more instructions. For example, to get the results from Simulations 1 for Setting 4, simply run
```
python3 simulations.py -s 4
```
Similarly, the rank estimation results can be generated by running
```
python3 simulations.py -r
```
By default both of these calls assume that you have installed the relevant packages from the requirements.txt file, and that the following directory structure is in your current working directory:

```
data/
├── rank/
│   └── results/
└── subspace/
    ├── setting1/
    ├── setting2/
    ├── setting3/
    ├── setting4/
    └── results/
```

  ### Description

- **data/**  
  Root directory for all datasets and outputs.

- **rank/**  
  Contains data and outputs related to rank estimation simulations (Simulation 2).
  - **results/**: Stores result files generated from rank estimation simulations.

- **subspace/**  
  Contains data and outputs related to spSSA simulations (Simulation 1).
  - **setting1–setting4/**: Different settings for parameters and types of nonstationarities.
  - **results/**: Final results from spSSA simulations.
 
## Plotting the results

Once data has been simulated with the above commands, the plots of the paper can be replicated by using the functions from the file plots.py
